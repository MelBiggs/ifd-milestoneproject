Spotify measures energy from from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual","                            measure of intensity and activity. An energetic track will feel loud, fast and noisy. Death metal, for example, has high energy while a Bach prelude will have low energy.<br>Danceability is measure by how suitable a track is","                            for dancing, based on certain musical elements including beat strength, tempo, rhythm stability and regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.<br>A track with high valence will sound more positive","                            (e.g. cheerful, happy) and a track with low valance will sound more negative (e.g. sad, angry).

Spotify measures energy from from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual","                            measure of intensity and activity. An energetic track will feel loud, fast and noisy. Death metal, for example, has high energy while a Bach prelude will have low energy.<br>Danceability is measure by how suitable a track is","                            for dancing, based on certain musical elements including beat strength, tempo, rhythm stability and regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.<br>A track with high valence will sound more positive","                            (e.g. cheerful, happy) and a track with low valance will sound more negative (e.g. sad, angry).
