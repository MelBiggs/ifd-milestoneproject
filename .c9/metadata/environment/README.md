I wanted to make good use of the dataset and incorporate a minimalist and modern design which I aimed to do by breaking each of the data charts up onto separate tiles. ","As the dataset is regarding Spotify’s most popular tracks, I wanted to implement a colour palette which mirrors that of Spotify. This involved keeping the background colours dark with white fonts and green **(#1DB954)** splashes of colour. ","With this dashboard, the target audience consists of all age groups who have an interest in popular music, those who wish to know what the audio feature similarities are for these tracks and musicians who may wish to incorporate these features into their own music.","### User Stories","As an individual interested in popular music, I would want to be able to use this dashboard to see what the most popular artists and tracks were of 2018 and the individual audio features that is shared among these. I would like to be able to see how different songs I may know score in terms of energy, danceability, valence, key, mode and genre. ","As a user who wishes to know what makes up a Top 100 song, I would like to be able to see the breakdown of audio features, and how some of these interact. I want to see the similarities and differences of the features of the entire Top 100. Filtering down to one song, I want to be able to be able to see specifically want the make up of that song is. ","As a musician or producer who wishes to release music that has a better chance of generating attention, I would like to be able to see what kind of formula popularly streamed music may have. Is the music generally in a major chord? What key do people seem to prefer? Should it be a dance song?","As a user who may be of an older demographic, I want a website which is easily navigated so that I can move through the webpage with ease.","As a user who may be of a young demographic, I want the information to be laid out in a way that is understandable in order to make the most of the data present. ","As a user I would prefer the option to reset the chosen filters to avoid having to individually remove each of the filters myself.

These are dynamic and change depending on the selections made by the user. ","**Artist filter**: This feature allows the user to filter the data according to a specific artist.","**Line Charts**: Two line charts show the analysis of tracks by their energy and danceability.","**Scatter plot**:  A scatter plot incorporates the energy and danceability features with valence to show how these all relate to each other. ","**Comment card**: A comment card puts the data represented into words in case a user is not accustomed to reading data from a chart. ","**Pie Charts**: Two pie charts show an analysis of the frequency of particular keys and modes used in the music. These can be clicked-on to recalculate the results. ","**Row Chart**: A row chart shows who the Top 18 Artists are in the dataset. This is dynamic and changes depending on the selections made by the user.","**Bar Chart**: The top 6 genres of the year are displayed with a bar chart. Clicking on one of these affects the other charts. ","**Reset Button**: This feature that enables users to reset all their selection.","**Fact Cards with Links**: Three cards with interesting facts about Spotify are listed at the end of the page. The icons contain links to the sources of these facts. ","**Footer**: A footer at the end contains a link to the dataset and a link to Spotify’s main page. ","**Responsive**: This dashboard has been made responsive so it allows the user to access this page through their mobile, tablet or desktop and have a pleasant user experience each time.","### Features Left to Implement","In the future, I would like to add more features to this dashboard, such as:","Adding more datasets for other years, incorporating this data with the 2018 dataset and documenting how the data has changed.
