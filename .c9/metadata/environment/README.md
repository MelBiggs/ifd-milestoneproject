A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:","","Contact form:","Go to the \"Contact Us\" page","Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears","Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears","Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.","In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.","","You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.","","If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.","","### Deployment","This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).","","In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:","","Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?","Different configuration files?","Separate git branch?","In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.","","Credits","Content","The text for section Y was copied from the Wikipedia article Z","Media","The photos used in this site were obtained from ...","Acknowledgements","I received inspiration for this project from X","","Bootswatch Slate template","Logo from https://logohub.io/","Favicon from https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/headphone/"],"id":214},{"start":{"row":136,"column":0},"end":{"row":180,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["## Testing","* As an individual interested in popular music, I believe they will reach their intended goal. They can navigate the page and find out the audio features of their choice of the top 70 artists along with how many songs they have in the Top 100. They can follow the links for more information and read the comment card to have the charts explained. I manually tested each of the links to the band's social media accounts and each of these opened on a separate tab (due to using 'target=\"_blank\"') to the correct destination.","* As a musician or producer who wishes to release music that has a better chance of generating attention or a user who wishes to know what makes up a Top 100 song, they can also see the energy, danceability, valence and genre that are prevalent in the Top 100. They can see what artist is most popular. They’ll see that the majority of the songs have high energy and danceability, they are relatively positive-sounding and that Hip-Hop/Rap and Pop are the most popular genres. ","*As a user of an older age, I want it to be as easily navigated as possible and attractive on a desktop or tablet. Younger users may more regularly use their phone and while the dashboard is best on a larger screen size, I believe my project allows the user to achieve their goals in an easy, straightforward and pleasant way. On different screen sizes and browsers, the project looks good.","There was a bug with the valence, energy and danceability correlation chart. It would not respond to efforts to make it responsive. Using `< useViewBoxResizing(true)>` didn’t throw an error but the chart would not appear in its card. That issue was resolved by adding `< #energy_to_danceability_to_valence{ height: 70%; width: 50%; }>` to the style sheet. It is now responsive and shrinks with the screen.
